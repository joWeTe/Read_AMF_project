# Read_AMF_Reed_Manuscript

Project 
CSV document containing the colonisation data used in the analyses. Along with it is the R code used for this analyses.

AMF_RESULTS_CSV_3.csv --> CSV file containing all data related to root colonisation assessment. Contains all colonisation metrics: F_RS; IC_RS; IC_RF; AA_RS; AA_RF; VA_RS; VA_RF, for all samples.
Colonisation_data_analyses_R --> R code for the analyses of the colonisation metric data for the reed root samples.

# Arbuscular mycorrhizal associations persist in flooded sediment, with distinct communities in soil-born and sediment-born roots of Phragmites australis
Study of the presence of Arbsucule Mycorrhizal Fungi in a dutch aquatic ecosystem.

# Description
We sampled 100 year old reed fields (_Phragmites australis_) to study the presence of arbsucule mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) between soil-borne reed roots and aquatic-borne reed roots. Root colonisation of AMF and sequencing of these microbial community was assessed to identify presence and diversity of aquatic AMF. This Github Folder contains the data as well as the R code used in the analyses.
